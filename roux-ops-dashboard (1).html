Thank you for reaching out about your Husky Card photo submission. I understand you're looking to get your ID card processed and are wondering about pickup details.

[If photo needs correction: I've reviewed your photo and notice that the background doesn't meet our requirements. For uniformity and clarity, we require a white, clear background for all ID photos. You may either resend a new photo with the correct background or visit the campus front desk to have your photo taken - we're happy to help with either option.]

Your Husky card will be ready for pickup at The Roux Institute front desk anytime within work hours (Monday-Friday 8am-10pm, Saturday & Sunday 9am-5pm).

[If previous cards exist: Please note that any old or missing cards will be nullified once your new one is printed for security purposes.]
